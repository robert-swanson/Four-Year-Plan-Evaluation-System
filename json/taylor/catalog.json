The goal is to prepare students to  critically interpret the research of others and to undertake research projects in  course-based labs, through independent or summer research projects, and post graduation research programs. Class topics will include defining a research question, hypothesis formulation, experimental design (correlation vs. necessity or sufficiency),  controls, power and the role of statistics, interpreting results, and presenting and  publishing results. The course will also include a series of instructor and student led  seminars on articles and techniques relevant to a targeted research field."

The goal is to improve  understanding of conflict: That constructive conflict is healthy and necessary, how  creative conflict can degenerate into destructive personal conflict, the causes of team  dysfunction, how to achieve team synergy, and personal techniques for engaging in  constructive conflict, avoiding destructive conflict and redeeming it should it happen.  The Bible is used as a discussion resource. The pre-supposition of the course is that  evangelical Christian culture encourages conflict avoidance within the culture and often  without. Some strive to be \u201cmeek and mild\u201d like Jesus, an aspiration that belies an  incomplete understanding of Jesus\u2019 character and behavior.
