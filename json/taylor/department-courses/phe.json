These tools include process and methodology tools, analytical tools, software tools,  and hardware tools. A goal of the course is to provide the students with a frame work for their engineering studies along with a practical ‘hands-on’ example of what  engineering might “look like.” This framework should help the student better  understand the role, need, and benefit of each successive course in their major. A  group hardware project will be carried out as part of the course, helping to engage  the students’ learning and interest, and re-enforcing the concepts taught in class.  One hour of lecture and three hours of lab. Offered January interterm. Prerequisite: PHY  211.",
